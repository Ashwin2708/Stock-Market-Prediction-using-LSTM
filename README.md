# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM

## 🚀 Introduction
This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model to predict stock market prices. By analyzing historical data from a CSV file, the model provides visual representations through charts and offers users the ability to predict stock prices for the next day.

## 🌐 Key Features
- **Data Import:** Reads historical stock data from CSV files.
- **LSTM Model:** Utilizes LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting.
- **Visualization:** Displays stock market trends and predictions through interactive charts.
- **Next-Day Predictions:** Allows users to request stock price predictions for the upcoming day.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training the LSTM model)

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-market-prediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the main notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🔗 Usage Instructions
1. Load the desired CSV file containing historical stock data.
2. Train the LSTM model on the dataset.
3. View the visualizations of historical data and predictions.
4. Request a prediction for the next trading day.
